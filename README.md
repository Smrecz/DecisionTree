# DecisionTree

DecisionTree is a lightweight open source framework that helps you define decision trees via config and generates DOT graph definition.<br>

# Aim

DecisionTree is aimed to provide a skeleton to build your decision tree around and to facilitate logic understanding, requirements cross-check and knowledge sharing by generating visualization definition in DOT language.<br>

# Graph definition in DOT
DOT language is used to define graphs and is understood by many tools.<br>
(all of which have dependency on Graphviz: https://graphviz.org/)<br>

DecisionTree's ConvertToDotGraph() method output can be used to generate a graph visualisation.<br>
You can use on-line tools like for example: https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/<br>

# Examples
Check out [ProjectDecisionTree.cs](https://github.com/Smrecz/DecisionTree/blob/master/DecisionTree.Tests/Tree/ProjectDecisionTree.cs) as an example of defined decision tree.<br>
Check out [DecisionTreeTest.cs](https://github.com/Smrecz/DecisionTree/blob/master/DecisionTree.Tests/DecisionTreeTest.cs) for tree usage.<br>

Below is a graph from generated DOT definition ([DOT](https://github.com/Smrecz/DecisionTree/blob/master/DecisionTree.Tests/approvals/DecisionTreeTest.DecisionTree_Should_Define_Graph.approved.html)):<br>
